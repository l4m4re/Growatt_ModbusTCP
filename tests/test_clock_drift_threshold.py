"""A whole-hour offset is a timezone, and the drift notice can be turned off (#439).

An owner in Åland could not clear the clock-drift notification. Pressing Inverter Clock Sync
worked, and the datalogger overwrote it about a minute later:

    17:08:38   inverter clock 16:08:17
    17:09:17   inverter clock 17:09:16   <- sync, correct
    17:10:20   inverter clock 16:10:01   <- reverted, exactly one hour back

The Growatt portal's plant timezone field offers fixed UTC offsets with no daylight-saving
zones. His is UTC+2: right in winter, an hour behind from late March to late October. The
datalogger pushes that to the inverter, so the offset is **structural** - there is no portal
setting that fixes it, and a scheduled sync would fight the dongle indefinitely and burn
EEPROM writes for nothing.

Two changes, and the first matters more than the escape hatch:

  * **A whole-hour offset is reported as a timezone, not as drift.** An RTC drifts
    gradually and does not arrive at exactly 3600 s. Telling this owner to press Sync was
    advice that could not work on his hardware; the notice now says so and explains why.

  * **The threshold is configurable, and 0 turns the notice off.** For a plant where the
    offset cannot be corrected at all, the only honest answer is a way to stop asking.
