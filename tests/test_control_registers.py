"""Controls must be backed by a register, and scoped to the models that have it.

`WRITABLE_REGISTERS` (const.py) defines a control; a profile's `holding_registers` decides
whether it is offered. Nothing checked the two against each other — the sensor side has
`test_sensor_integrity.py`, the control side had nothing — so a control could name a
register no profile maps, or a profile could offer one its hardware rejects, and neither
showed up until a user wrote to it.

#371 is what that costs. MOD TL3-XH mapped 1090 and 1092 while the entire holding block
1000-1124 is unimplemented on that firmware: both reject writes with exception 2. Users
were shown two grid-charge switches, one of which silently did nothing.
