# ============================================================================
# Ten inverter families exist as two register maps - a V1.39 legacy one and a VPP V2.01 one.
# Which is used comes from `vpp_protocol_confirmed`, set by auto-detection at setup, and the
# profile dropdown deliberately shows one plain name for both: the distinction is an
# implementation detail of the protocol and most users never need it.
#
# It still has to be correctable. When the stored flag disagrees with the hardware there was
# no way back - re-selecting the same family name re-resolved through the same flag, so the
# only escape was deleting the config entry and losing entity IDs, automations and history.
# That is what made #377 take two days: a fix landed in the profile the reporter was not on,
# his own detection output said "no VPP support", and he could not act on it.
#
# AUTO keeps whatever detection concluded, so nothing changes for anyone who does not go
# looking. The two explicit values override it.

# PEAK SHAVING — UNSET LIMITS (#380)
# ============================================================================
# The demand-management power limits (3307, 3308, 3311) sit at a ceiling rather than at
# zero when peak shaving has never been configured. Measured on a MID 25KTL3-XH: 30000 on
# both demand limits and 65535 on the AC charge limit, which decode at x0.1 to 3000 kW and
# 6553.5 kW on a 25 kW inverter.
#
# A *configured* MOD 10KTL3-XH on the same register map reads 75 (7.5 kW) on all three, so
# these sentinels do not collide with a legitimate setting. The read succeeds either way —
# nothing errors and nothing logs — so without this the sensors publish a stable, typed,
# entirely wrong number.
#
# The ceiling is a backstop for unset encodings we have not seen. It mirrors the 1000 kWh
# sanity limit already applied to PV energy sums: no single-inverter demand limit in this
# range is a real setting.

# identically whether it was configured or left at the factory default, on both the MOD and
# the MID. Unset is undetectable by value there, so guessing would be worse than leaving it.

# tuned for a dedicated RS485 gateway, and on a Growatt WiFi dongle they produce a specific
# and confusing failure - transaction IDs that come back exactly one behind, cascading into
# resets and unavailable entities a minute or two after setup (#433).
#
# That cascade is not corruption. pymodbus assigns a transaction ID before its retry loop
# and reuses it on each resend, so a device slower than the timeout answers both the
# original request and its retry. One answer satisfies the retry, the second waits in the
# buffer, and every read after that receives the previous read's answer. Reads then keep
# timing out, which causes more retries, which leaves more stale answers. Nothing recovers
# it but restarting the dongle - and it recurs.

# time, and leave gaps between them. Asking one question at setup does that for the people
# who would otherwise spend an evening on it.

# register named `inverter_status` — address 0 on most families, 3000 on
# MIN_TL_XH_3000_10000_V201. The hybrid table nominally describes two OTHER registers:
#   - reg 31000 `equipment_status`  → data.equipment_status (see VPP_V201_STATUS)
#   - reg 1000  `system_work_mode`  → not read into data.status on any profile except SPA
#
# On MOD, WIT and TL-XH that distinction holds: their reg 0 really does carry the standard
# 0/1/3 semantics, and mapping them to 'hybrid' rendered a normal inverter (value 1) as
# "Self-Test". Those four are field-confirmed against ShinePhone:
#   GreenThumb91  MOD5000TL3-X    (fixed v1.0.4)
#   uspino2       MIN 6000TL-XH   (fixed v1.1.2)
#   Fyntiker      WIT 8k-HU       (fixed v1.1.3)
#   Husplace      MOD 6000TL3-HU  (fixed v1.1.3)
#
# On SPH it does NOT hold. v1.1.3 also removed SPH and SPH-TL3 on the strength of their
# `desc` strings alone, with no field confirmation. darimar then reported an SPH-4600 V2.01
# rendering "Unknown (6)" — and STATUS_CODES has no entry for 6 at all, so that hardware is
# emitting hybrid-range values from reg 0 and the `desc` string is simply wrong (#363).
# Restored to 'hybrid' in v1.1.7.
#
# THE LESSON: a profile's `desc` string is documentation, not evidence. Several are
# inherited boilerplate that no one has checked against hardware. Do not move a family
# between status tables on the strength of a `desc` — get a user to report the raw register
# value alongside what ShinePhone shows, for at least two different operating states.
#
# `grid_connection_status` in sensor.py shows the robust alternative: it gates on
# `equipment_status_valid`, so it only applies VPP semantics when reg 31000 was genuinely
# read, rather than inferring from the profile at all.
